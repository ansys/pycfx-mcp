"""Shared string-matching utilities for fuzzy/typo-tolerant lookup.

These helpers are used everywhere the agent has to reconcile an
LLM-supplied identifier against a finite, authoritative set of known
strings — material names, allowed values of an enum-typed setting,
NamedObject keys, dict-key schemas, command kwargs, etc.

Keeping the implementation in one place avoids the trap we hit
historically: ``_check_value`` learned to tolerate the LLM's
``"least-squares-cell-based"`` → ``"least-square-cell-based"`` typo
while ``copy_material`` could not even resolve ``"water-vapour"`` →
``"water-vapor"``. Both are the same single-edit problem; both should
share the same solution.

Public API:
    * :func:`edit_distance_le_one` — fast ``≤ 1`` Levenshtein verdict.
    * :func:`fuzzy_normalize` — return the canonical spelling if and
      only if exactly one entry in ``allowed`` is within edit distance
      1 (case-insensitive), else ``None``.
    * :func:`sanitize_named_object_key` — collapse whitespace in a
            NamedObject key to the idiomatic hyphen separator.

    name: str,

) -> tuple[str, str | None]:
    r"""Return ``(sanitized_name, notice_or_None)`` for a NamedObject key.

    Some backends reject whitespace in NamedObject instance keys (BC names,
    cell-zone names, material names, named-expression keys, ...).
    Internal whitespace runs are collapsed to ``replacement`` (hyphen
    by default — the idiomatic separator, e.g.
    ``pressure-outlet-1``, ``phase-1``, ``cold-inlet``) and leading
    or trailing whitespace is stripped.

    The function is conservative — it ONLY rewrites whitespace.
    Other illegal characters (``/``, ``\\``, ``:``, brackets, ...) are
    rare in natural-language intent and are deliberately left alone
    so a deterministic rewrite never corrupts a name the user
    intentionally typed; the backend surfaces those at apply time.

    Returns a 2-tuple:

    * ``sanitized_name``  — the cleaned name (equal to ``name`` when
      no rewrite was needed).
    * ``notice``          — a one-line human-readable explanation of
      the rewrite, or ``None`` when the input was already clean.

    Non-string inputs are returned unchanged with ``notice=None`` so
    callers can pipe values through this helper unconditionally.

    Example::

        >>> sanitize_named_object_key("oil inlet")
        ('oil-inlet', "name 'oil inlet' contained whitespace; ...")
        >>> sanitize_named_object_key("phase-1")
        ('phase-1', None)

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        Name of the object, module, or setting being processed.
    replacement : str
        Replacement supplied to the function.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[str, str | None]
        Collection containing the operation results.
